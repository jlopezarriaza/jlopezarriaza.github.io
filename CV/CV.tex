%The job advertisement for Data Scientist sparked my attention. My thorough training in statistical analysis with an emphasis on Bayesian statistics would make me an excellent candidate for the position.
%
%During my Ph.D. program I have worked on a variety of projects that broadly aim at incorporating mathematical and statistical methods to study a variety of questions ranging from optimal management of natural resources to theoretical Bayesian inference methodology. Additionally, during this time I have received extensive training in mathematical and statistical modeling. 
%
%I also have a proficiency to perform scientific computing in a variety of languages including R, Matlab and Python. I also believe that my current work on the development of a non-parametric multi-objective optimization framework for time-series processes has given me relevant skills for the position due to the necessity to leverage real-world data and statistical methodologies to answer tough questions. Working in an highly collaborative environment with scientists from many fields has has allowed me to refine my ability to relay technical information to a broad range of audiences.
%
%I have become very interested and gained expertise in both the development and application of statistical and mathematical tools to better understand a broad range of interesting, applied problems and their implications. I have also become experienced both with statistical and mathematical methodologies. I believe my previous experience in statistics and applied mathematics would make a perfect candidate for the proposed position.
%
%I welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further with you. Thank you for your time and consideration.

%%I welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further with you.  Thank you for your time and consideration.
%%I am currently a Doctoral Candidate in the Applied Mathematics and Statistics Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz working with Professor Marc Mangel and plan on graduating in spring or summer 2015. I am contacting you regarding the available postdoctoral position for the development of novel tools for multi-species ecosystem-based-fisheries management.
%%
%%As an undergraduate at UC Merced, I conducted independent research through UC LEADS, a program whose goal is to prepare underrepresented students for an academic track through two years of mentor guided summer research at two different UC institutions. At UC Merced, I worked on problems related to solute transport in saturated porous media and soil aggregate formation (see Lopez Arriaza and Ghezzehei 2011 in my CV for publication details). The second summer of the program I worked with Prof Mangel and Dr. Will Satterthwaite on the analysis and validation of growth models for steelhead. Although the subject matter on which I worked was completely different than my previous work, it highlighted the versatility of mathematics in real world problems. In addition, the research I did with Prof. Mangel ignited my interested to develop and apply new mathematical methodologies to solve meaningful problems in biology and was the motivating factor for me to return to UC Santa Cruz for my Ph.D.
%%
%%My M.Sc. thesis involved two chapters. First, I developed an illustrative stochastic dynamic program to assess the effects of spatial incentives in the reduction of by-catch (see Mangel et al 2014 in my CV for details of publication). Much like the problem at hand in your proposal, a large part of the machinery for the joint management of species and accounting for the behavioral choices of fishermen was available but underutilized. The work, published in \emph{Environmental Resource Economics}, allowed us to highlight the applicability of these methodologies in a new context. The second chapter of my M.Sc. thesis (Boughton et al in press) involved parametric modeling of the thermal ecology of steelhead in a drainage in Southern California.
%%
%%During my Ph.D. program, I have worked on a variety of projects that broadly focus on incorporating mathematical and statistical methods to study questions in ecology and fisheries with the aim of integrating fieldwork, laboratory work and both statistical and mathematical tools to better understand how environmental factors affect the growth, survival and migratory tendencies of steelhead. More specifically, my Ph.D. thesis is composed of three chapters: 1) the development of a Physiologically Structured Population model for steelhead trout to study the non-linear dynamics that arise through temperature-dependent growth, size-dependent mortality, and intraspecific competition; 2) the development of a Bayesian semi-parametric approach based on Gaussian processes to estimate individual growth and capture the effects of temporal variation in environmental conditions (e.g. food availability and temperature) while avoiding parametric forms; 3) a tagging study of steelhead to determine the effects of individual growth and multiple management strategies on the overall dynamics of steelhead in the Carmel River.
%%
%%Throughout my academic career, I have been very interested in both the development and application of statistical and mathematical tools to better understand ecological processes and their implications in the management of fisheries. I have also experienced the difficulties with parameterizing models, even for species, which are of high interest and highly studied. I believe my previous work on semi-parametric modeling as well as my work on stochastic dynamic programming for the management for fisheries would make a perfect candidate for the proposed project. I view this postdoctoral position as a great stepping-stone in my future career; whether it be an agency such as NMFS or at a research university.
